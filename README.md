# ML Driver Evaluation Pipeline

This project automates the evaluation of Linux character device drivers, especially those generated by LLMs. It supports code generation, compilation, static analysis, style checking, and scoring, with multi-architecture and kernel-specific checks.

## Features
- **Driver Generation:** Uses LLM (Gemini API) to generate a simple character device driver from a prompt.
- **Compilation:** Cross-compiles the generated driver for x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.
- **Static Analysis:** Runs `cppcheck`, `checkpatch.pl`, and `sparse` for code quality and kernel compliance.
- **Style & Documentation Checks:** Analyzes code for style, comments, and maintainability.
- **Scoring:** Aggregates results into a comprehensive score.
- **Runtime Simulation:** Checks for required driver functions and simulates module load/unload.

## Usage
1. Place your driver prompt in `basic_char_driver.txt`.
2. Run `main.py` to generate, compile, analyze, and score the driver.
3. Results are printed to the console and intermediate files are saved in `test_samples/`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Linux kernel headers for cross-compilation
- `cppcheck`, `checkpatch.pl`, and `sparse` tools installed
